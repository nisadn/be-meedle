## About Meedle

This is a college assignment for Information Retrieval course. Meedle is a medical search engine that uses collections from Medline and BM25 as the scoring method. The project consisted of two repositories. This is my backend repo and the other one is for [frontend](https://github.com/nisadn/meedle).
